# STAFFLINK
•	Implemented CRUD Operations: Developed and exposed RESTful API endpoints that allow users to create, read, update, and delete employee records.
•	Custom Exception Handling: Designed and implemented a custom exception handling mechanism to catch and handle errors in the application.
•	Field Validation: Integrated data validation using Spring Boot’s validation annotations to ensure that incoming data meets the required formats and constraints before processing it.
•	API Documentation using Swagger: Utilized Swagger to automatically generate interactive API documentation. This tool enables both developers and clients to easily explore and understand 
   the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.
•	API Testing with Postman: Used Postman to thoroughly test the API endpoints for correctness and reliability.
•	Response Structure and Response Entity: A custom response structure is used to return meaningful responses, including message and data, with appropriate status code. The Response Entity class is employed for flexible HTTP response management.
