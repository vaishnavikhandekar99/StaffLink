# STAFFLINK
The StaffLink is designed to manage employee data through a RESTful API. This Spring Boot-based system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee information. <br><br>
•	Implemented CRUD Operations: Developed and exposed RESTful API endpoints that allow users to create, read, update, and delete employee records.<br>
•	Custom Exception Handling: Designed and implemented a custom exception handling mechanism to catch and handle errors in the application.<br>
•	Field Validation: Integrated data validation using Spring Boot’s validation annotations to ensure that incoming data meets the required formats and constraints before processing it.<br>
•	API Documentation using Swagger: Utilized Swagger to automatically generate interactive API documentation. This tool enables both developers and clients to easily explore and understand 
   the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. <br>
•	API Testing with Postman: Used Postman to thoroughly test the API endpoints for correctness and reliability.<br>
•	Response Structure and Response Entity: A custom response structure is used to return meaningful responses, including message and data, with appropriate status code. The Response Entity 
   class is employed for flexible HTTP response management.<br>
   Environment :- Spring Boot, MYSQL, POSTMAN, Swagger
